        <p>
            The goal of this project was to fetch sucessufully data from the Rick and Morty API and display it in a user friendly way, also to implement CRUD operations and user authentication, authorization using JWT.

        <h3>My Role and Project Scope</h3>
        <p>
            In this project i took the role as a Full Stack Developer,I were involved in fetching data from the Rick and Morty API and displaying it in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, I implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to interact with the data, as well as user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access control.The frontend is menaged by React context API where i used the useReducer hook to manage the state of the application.
