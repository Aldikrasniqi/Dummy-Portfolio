        <h1>Adopt Me</h1>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of the "Adopt-Me" project is to create a React and JavaScript-based web application that connects prospective pet owners with adoptable animals. The project aims to leverage the power of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to deliver a dynamic and interactive user experience.
        </p>
        <h3>My Role and Project Scope</h3>
        <p>
          In this project, I took on the role of a full-stack developer. My responsibilities included designing and implementing the web application's front-end . I developed the user interface,implemented search and filtering functionality to allow users to refine their search for adoptable pets based on specific criteria., Implemented state management using React's built-in state and props system to handle data updates and user interactions.
        </p>
